/*
 * Per-uba structure.
 *
 * This structure holds the interrupt vector for the uba,
 * and its address in physical and virtual space.  At boot time
 * we determine the devices attached to the uba's and their
 * interrupt vectors, filling in uh_vec.  We free the map
 * register and bdp resources of the uba into the structures
 * defined here.
 *
 * During normal operation, resources are allocated and returned
 * to the structures here.  We watch the number of passive releases
 * on each uba, and if the number is excessive may reset the uba.
 * 
 * When uba resources are needed and not available, or if a device
 * which can tolerate no other uba activity (rk07) gets on the bus,
 * then device drivers may have to wait to get to the bus and are
 * queued here.  It is also possible for processes to block in
 * the unibus driver in resource wait (mrwant, bdpwant); these
 * wait states are also recorded here.
