/*	TODO	4.10	81/04/15	*/

1. Minor
	- Put u.u_ttyd in proc structure and fix sys.c (/dev/tty) and chfile()
	- Turn the u. and kernel stack around and use a virtual hole as redzone
	- Hash the process groups in the proc table so wakeups are fast
	- Use pointers for process hashing, not indices.
	- Also use pointers in inode table.
	- Discard init code after boot.
	- Allocate spt at boot
	- Cleanup handling of file table.
	- Add child and sibling pointers in proc table.
	- Remove all linear searches of tables.
	- Deal with dh NXM problem
	- Test rm80 sse code
	- Find and fix ttrstrt problem
	- Why did up drive give i/o errors after uba reset when tape was hung?
	- Incorporate good stuff from ghg's system
	- Fix rpb autorestart
	- Handle sbi alert/fault
	- Get multi-porting code to work

2. Error logging/handling
	- Improve error logging, by adding a binary error log file
	- Write a user mode program to decipher the error log file
	- Log soft device errors and produce a dec-like error log
	- (cn,tn,sn) for disks; soft errors; ecc: pat, pos
	- Write a better analyze program more like sda

3. New stuff
	- File system (new data structures, new policies)
	- Vm primitives (segmentation, copy-on-write)
	- Ipc (fast datagrams, named pipes, vc stuff)
	- Local net support (chaosnet, etc.)
	- Incorporate bbn arpa net support
	- Project support
	- Sccs replacement

4. Benchmarking
	- Get hardware clock
	- Run jm's benchmarks
	- Run tracing experiments
