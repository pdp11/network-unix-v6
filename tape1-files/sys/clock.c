 * Hardclock is called straight from

 * We limit the work we do at real clock interrupt time to:
 *	reloading clock
 *	decrementing time to callouts
 *	recording cpu time usage
 *	modifying priority of current process
 *	arrange for soft clock interrupt
 *	kernel pc profiling
 *
 * At software (softclock) interrupt time we:
 *	implement callouts
 *	maintain date
 *	lightning bolt wakeup (every second)
 *	alarm clock signals
 *	jab the scheduler
 *
 * On the vax softclock interrupts are implemented by
 * software interrupts.  Note that we may have multiple softclock
 * interrupts compressed into one (due to excessive interrupt load),
 * but that hardclock interrupts should never be lost.
