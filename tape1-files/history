unix.32v	30 Nov 79	agn	Original Bell UNIX

u1.1.lp		30 Nov 79	agn	Moved swap to drive 1, added 16 line
					dz, added lp device.  Changed dz.c,
					conf.c, univec.c. Also, changed tty 
					mode NL3 to provide a pad of 020 after
					a new line for Ann Arbor.  Changed
					tty.c. Updated makefile and loadall.
					Moved dev/lp.c to sys/lp.c.

u1.2.lp		07 Dec 79	fram	Removed conversion of newline to
					formfeed from line printer driver
					(sys/lp.c).  Was causing whole
					blank pages on line printer listings.

u1.3.dz         12 Dec 79       fram    Commented out all references to modem
				        control bits in dz.c.  This was a  
					quick-and-dirty fix to make dz driver
					work with current-loop lines, for which
					modem status is undefined.  Does not
					hurt in EIA case either.  (Essentially,
					all our lines are "hard-wired", so 
					modem control is really unnecessary.)

u1.4.lp         18 Dec 79       fram    Edited lp.c to have default line 
					printer width of 80 columns (had been
					changed earlier to 132).  Note:  
					observed behavior after change is that
					line printer prints a max of 76 cols.
					This is a mystery.

u1.5.tty         4 Jan 80       edh     Changed tty.c to throw away extra
					X-ON X-OFF characters when reading
					from a terminal.

u1.6.mknod      11 Jan 80       fram    Changed mknod system call (sys2.c)
					so that third argument is not coerced
					to a short.  Allows specification of
					a generalized first block pointer
					which is useful for creating an inode
					which "captures" a specific bad block.

u1.7.tty        24 Jan 80       fram    Changed tty.c to handle X-ON/X-OFF  
					properly at interrupt level.  
					Supersedes fix made by edh in u1.5.tty
					on 4 Jan 80.

u1.8.tty        9 Feb 80        dbarach, Changed tty.c to cause anything
				rwells  on the tty input queue to cause
					gtty to set the 0x10000 bit in the
					flag word. This bit was unused by 
					the previous system. This is a quick
					and dirty empty() call for use in
					the editor.
