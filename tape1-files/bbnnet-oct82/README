This directory was not on the original beta distribution
tape. It contains a more developed version of the
networking kernel, presumably from October 1982 (one year
later than the tape). This version has support for UDP and
several bug fixes; it would have been the version used
on 'flag day'.

These files were found in the online archives of the
Stanford AI Laboratory (SAIL):

The files are mixed in with what looks like the TCP/IP
implementation for WAITS, where it may have been used
as a reference.
