The programs "dumpmap" and "loadmap" are not intended for public consumption.

dumpmap produces an ascii dump of the binary map and was written during
	debugging of the new library.

loadmap just loads and unloads the network map 100 times.  It may be used
	to determine how much time these functions consume.
	(E.g., time loadmap)
