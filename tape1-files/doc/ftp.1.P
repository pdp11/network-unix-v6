____NAME
     ftp - file transfer program

________SYNOPSIS
     ___     ftp [ host ]

___________DESCRIPTION
     ___     Ftp is  an  implementation  of  the  ARPANET  File  Transfer
     Protocol  for  UNIX  systems.  It is capable of transferring
     ASCII and core-image files between a  UNIX  host  and  other
     network   hosts,  of  providing  local  users  with  current
     information about remote file systems, and  of  providing  a
     mail facility.

                    ___     When executed, ftp attempts to establish communications with
     ____                                            ____     host.   If  the  argument is not present, or if host is does
                  ___                        ____     not respond, ftp will ask for another.  Host may be any host
                                       _______     identification  recognizable  to  gethost(3),  which accepts
     numerous formats.

     If the request succeeds, the remote  computer  will  respond
     with  a message like "300 CMU-10a FTP Server".  All messages
     sent by the remote host begin with  a  3-digit  number,  and
     generally  indicate  successful completion, or failure, of a
                            ___     request.   The  local  ftp  will  then  prompt  with  a  '>'
     character, indicating that it is ready to accept commands.

     ___     Ftp  commands  consist  of  a  command  name   followed   by
     arguments.   The command name need not be fully typed - only
     enough characters to resolve any ambiguities are  necessary.
     Generally  the  first  three characters are sufficient.  For
     those commands requiring arguments, the arguments may follow
     the  command  name  (as in the syntax below), or if none are
                ___     specified, ftp will ask  for  the  particular  arguments  it
     needs.   Unusual  arguments  (e.g.,  pathnames with embedded
     spaces) may be quoted  with  single  or  double  quotes.   A
     command summary follows.

     ______ _______ ________     Access Control Commands.  These include  the  operations  of
     identifying  the  user  to  the  remote  host, verifying the
     password, and recording accounting information.

     ___     log username [ password account ]
            This command identifies the user to the remote  host,
            by  supplying  the   first   parameter.   If either a
            password or account number is requested by the remote
            host,     the     second    or    third    parameter,
            respectively,  is  supplied  to  the  host.   If  the
            parameter was not typed, the user is prompted for it.
                          ____      _______            As with  the  Pass  and Account commands, below,  the
            argument   is  not  echoed  when  it  is  read  after

            prompting.  (To type the account number on  the  same
            line   with  the  username and still be able to enter
            the  password  with  echo  supressed,  enter  a  null
            string,   i.e.   two   single   or double  quotes  as
            the   second   parameter   of   the   log   command.)
            Unneeded  parameters  are  ignored.    This   command
                            ____  ____      _______            supercedes  the User, Pass, and Account commands  for
            most purposes.

     ____     user username
            Generally  this  is  the  first  command  after   the
                                           ________            connection  is  established.   Username  is the login
            identifier for the remote computer.

     ________     password
                               ____            If the response to user was  "Enter  Password",  this
                                        ___            command  should  be given.  Ftp will then ask for the
            password.   Local  echoing  will  be  suppressed  for
            security.

     _______     ____     account (or acct)
                                  ____      ________            If the  response  to  user  or  password  was  "Enter
                                                         ___            Account",  this  command  should  be given.  Ftp will
            then ask for an account number.  Local  echoing  will
            be suppressed for security.

     ____ ________ ______________     Data Transfer Specifications.  These describe the format  of
     the  data.   Since all data transfer parameters have default
     values, these commands are only needed when special types of
     data  are to be transferred.  Specified parameters remain in
     force until reset.   To  find  out  what  current  parameter
                        ______     values  are,  the  status  command  (described under service
                             ___     commands) may be used.  Ftp only permits an  8-bit  transfer
     byte size, which is the network default.

     ____  _____  _____  _____     type {ascii, image, local}
                                      _____                 _____            Specifies the data type.  ascii  is  default.   Image
            means  a  core-image  file.  Generally it is not very
            useful to transfer an image file  to/from  a  machine
                                       _____            that  is  not  a  PDP-11.  Local means that each host
            should use its own idea of the appropriate format.

     ____  ______  ____     mode {stream, text}
                                                       ______            Specifies the transfer mode to be  used.   Stream  is
                       ____                 _____            default.   Text may be used for ascii files only.  It
                                                          ______            is better with record - structured files than stream,
            which  cannot  embed <EOR> and <EOF> control codes in
            the data stream.

     _________  ____  ______     structure {file, record}
                     _________            Sets the structure of the  file  to  be  transferred.

            ______            record is set, the following mapping occurs: on input
            each <EOR> becomes  a  newline  and  on  output  each
            newline becomes an <EOR>.

     _______ ________     Service Commands.  These cause the files to be  transferred,
     and also request the remote host to perform various actions.

                        ___            the  local  ftp  process,  which  will  store  it  as
            _________            localfile.

                       ___                         __________            The remote ftp will transfer the file  remotefile  to
                        ___            the  local  ftp  process,  which  will  pipe  it into
            command, which  may  be  any  valid  shell  statement
            capable of acting as a filter.

     _________     mretrieve remfgd [-flags]

     ____     mget remfgd [-flags]
            ______      ______ ____ _____ __________            Remfgd is a remote file group descriptor, that is,  a
            string  that  the operating system of the remote host
            will recognize as a  string  specifying  a  group  of
                      _____            files.    Flags   specifies  the  transformations  to
            perform on the file names to create local file names.
                                                                _            The  flags  may be used in combination (except  and T
            cannot be used together).  The flag  argument  begins
            with a hyphen.  If the argument is omitted, the local
            file name is the same as the remote file name.   This
            command  uses the NLST protocol to obtain the list of
            names of files on the remote host.  Currently defined
            flags are:


     T    Tenex/Tops20-mode: strips the <. . .> directory and the
          protection   information  from  the  filename,  removes
          control-Vs, replaces  Tenex's  semi-colons  before  the
          version  number  with  periods,  and  converts to lower
          case.


     I    ITS mode: strips the "DSK: DIR;" from the beginning  of
          the filename, converts letters in the filename to lower
          case, and replaces spaces with under-scores.

                           __________            under the name remotefile.

     _______     cmdsend command remotefile
            The output of command is stored at  the  remote  host
                            __________            under  the name remotefile.  Command may be any valid
            shell statement.

     _____     msend localfgd
            ________            localfgd is a string definging a group of files;  the
            syntax  is  the  same  as that used by the shell (see
            __            sh(1)) to define files. They are stored on the remote
            host  with  the  same  name as they have on the local
            host.

     NOTE: The following  three  commands  (mstore/msend,  mkdir,
     rmdir)   use  experimental  protocols  which  are  currently

     ______     delete remotefile
            __________            Remotefile is deleted from the remote system.

     ______     status [ pathname ]

        ________                          ___     If pathname is not given, the remote ftp will  respond  with
     its  current  status (e.g., current parameter settings).  If
     ________     pathname is a file, the response is  information  about  the
                     ________     file;  and  if  pathname  is  a  directory,  the response is
     information about all files in the directory.

     ____     list pathname localfile
            ____          ________            List requires pathname to be a file or  directory  on
            the  remote  system.   The response is the same as to
                ______            the status request,  except  that  it  is  stored  in
            _________            localfile   and   is  not  displayed  on  the  user's
            terminal.

     ____     nlst pathname localfile
                                     ____            This command is like the list  command,  except  that
            ____            nlst  is  guaranteed  on return only a list of names,
                    ____            whereas list may return some status information  when
            pathname  specifies  a single file.  With some hosts,
                                 _____            notably those using  Tenex,  this  can  produce  more
                              ____            information  than list because qualifying information
            about the files is returned imbedded in the file name
            strings.

     ___     cwd pathname
            This command, if implemented by  the  remote  server,
            will  change  the working directory to that indicated
                ________            by  pathname.   The  interpretation   of   subsequent
            _________            pathnames  used  in  other  commands will be affected
            according to the remote system's concept  of  working
            directory.   Some  systems  have  no such concept, in
            which case a negative reply (usually 500  -  no  such
            command  -)   will  be returned, and further commands
                                                  ___            will be interpreted exactly as if the cwd command had
            not been issued.

            (Experimental  commands  may  be  implemented  by any
            server and always start with "X".)  Sending NOOP is a
            way  of  checking if the remote server is functioning
            without other side effects.  (A healthy  server  will
                                            ___            return  a 200 reply promptly.)  Ftp will wait for any
            final reply before returning to prompt level.  It may
            be brought back to prompt level arbitrarily by typing
            INTERRUPT, however.

     ___    ____     bye    quit
            Connections are closed and the user  is  returned  to
            the UNIX shell.

     _____________     Miscellaneous.

     !            Creates a temporary subshell.  This  is  useful
                  for  verifying  the  results of file transfers.
                            ___                  Note that ftp connections to  the  remote  host
                  remain open, tying up valuable system resources
                  at both ends.   Therefore  a  user  should  not
                  remain  in  a  subshell  for  any  longer  than
                  necessary.

FTP(1)              UNIX Programmer's Manual               FTP(1)



     ____     help         describes available commands.

     __                                   _____     cd           acts just like the UNIX chdir command.

      _________                 ___     <INTERRUPT>  Interrupting  ftp  with  an   INTERRUPT   (DEL)
                  character causes a network interrupt to be sent
                                ___                  to the remote ftp, followed  by  a  request  to
                  abort  any  ongoing  data transfer.  The remote
                  computer should reply  indicating  whether  any
                  transfer  was  aborted.   The  user  may resume
                                ___                  normal use of ftp afterwards.

      ____     <QUIT>       Panic - the QUIT (FS) character should only  be
                  used   when   the   connections  appear  to  be
                  hopelessly confused (for example, if the remote
                                      ___                  host  crashes)  or  ftp  appears  to be hanging
                  without  cause.   All  local  connections   are
                  broken  and  the  user  is returned to the UNIX
                  shell.

_____FILES
                                  ___     /etc/net/ftpmain        User-ftp process.

     /etc/net/aliases        User names for mail identification.

___ ____SEE ALSO
