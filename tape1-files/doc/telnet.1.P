____NAME
     telnet - communicate using TELNET protocol

________SYNOPSIS
     ______     telnet [ open-arguments ]

___________DESCRIPTION
         ______     The telnet command is used to communicate with another  host
     using  the  TELNET  protocol.   If  it  is  invoked  with no
     arguments, it enters command mode, indicated by  its  prompt
     (an  asterisk).   In  this mode, it accepts and executes the
     ______     telnet  commands  listed  below.   If  it  is  invoked  with
                                   ____     arguments,  it  performs  an  open  command (see below) with
                             ______ ________     those arguments.  Thus, telnet hostname opens  a  connection
        ________     to hostname.

                                        ______     Once a connection has been opened, telnet enters input mode.
                                     ______     In  this  mode,  text  typed to telnet is sent to the remote
                     ______     host.  To issue telnet commands when in input mode,  precede
                    ______ ______ _________     them  with the telnet escape character (initially '^').  All
                   ______ ______ _________     text from the telnet escape character to the end of the line
                           ______     is  taken  to  be  a  telnet  command.   Neither  the escape
     character nor the command is sent to the foreign  host.   To
     send the escape character, type two of them in succession.

     When in input mode, the normal terminal editing  conventions
     may  not  be  available,  rendering  it  difficult  to  type
                  ______     complicated  telnet  commands.   If  you  type   an   escape
                                        ______     character  at  the  end of a line, telnet will enter command
     mode for one line.

     The following commands are available.  Only enough  of  each
     command to uniquely identify it need be typed.

     ____     help, ?  Briefly explain each command.

     _______     verbose  Announce  all  changes  in  the   status   of   the
              connection.

     _____     brief    Announce only important changes in  the  status  of
              the connection (default).

     ____     quit     Close the connection and return to command level.

     __     ip       Send  an  Interrupt-Process  command.   This   will
              generally  interrupt  - that is, halt - the current
              command or process on the foreign host.

     __     ao       Send an Abort-Output command.  If the foreign  host
              implements  it, Abort-Output will cause output from
              the foreign host to  be  aborted,  but  permit  the

              current   command   or   process   to  continue  to
              completion.

     _____     synch    Send a TELNET Synch.

     _____     break    Send a Break command.  This command is intended  to
              simulate  pressing  the  BREAK  key  on  a terminal
              attached to the foreign host.

     __     ec       Send  an  Erase-Character  command.   This  command
              erases the last character sent to the foreign host,
              just  as  the  foreign  host's   indigenous   erase
              character would.

     __     el       Send an Erase-Line command.   This  command  erases
              the entire last line sent to the foreign host, just
              as  the  foreign   host's   indigenous   erase-line
              character would.

     __     ga       Send a Go-Ahead command.  This  command  is  useful
              only   in   special  circumstances,  such  as  when
              communicating with another terminal which  requires
              an explicit command to unlock its keyboard.

     ___     ayt      Send an Are-You-There command.  If the foreign host
              is  still  up and reading the user's characters, it
              will respond in some visible or audible way.   Note
              that  a  response  to  this command only guarantees
              that the server on the foreign host is up; it  does
              not  necessarily  imply anything about the state of
              the user's process or job.

     ____     stty     Set or display the terminal modes.  The  syntax  is
                                            ____              identical to that of the UNIX stty (1) command.  If
              the command is issued with no  arguments,  it  will
              merely  print  out the current terminal modes, just
                   ____              like stty.

     ______     modtty   Set or display the extended terminal  modes.   This
                                                   ______              command  merely  invokes  the system modtty command
              (if it exists).

     _     x        Invoke the Shell and pass it the rest of  the  line
              for  execution.   While  the  Shell is invoked, the
              modes of the terminal are changed to those  in  use
                   ______              when telnet was invoked.  If there are no arguments
                 _              to x, the shell will read from the  standard  input
              until an EOT (CNTRL-D) is typed instead.

     ____     open [ host-id ] [ option ] . . .

     _______     connect [ host-id ] [ option ] . . .
              Open a network connection to  the  specified  host.
                  _______              The options are as follows:

      __     -fs #    Use  the  specified  foreign  socket  number.   The
              default is socket 23.

      _     -t #     Set timeout.  If the connection  attempt  does  not
              complete  in  the  specified  number of seconds, it
              will be aborted.

      __     -ls #    Use the specified local socket number.  The default
                                         ______              is  unspecified,  unless  -server  is specified, in
              which case it is socket 23 decimal.

      ______     -direct

      ____     -init

      ________     -specific

      ______     -server

      ______     -duplex

      ________     -relative
              These options set the corresponding  flags  in  the
              call   upon   the   NCP.   Their  use  is  somewhat
              specialized and will not be  described  here.   See
              NCP (4).

      __ ____     -fd fdes This option sets the file descriptor  used  by  the
                               ________              NCP  when  the  -relative option is specified.  Its
              use is somewhat specialized.  See NCP (4).

                                                ______                After the command  is  issued,  telnet  will  say
                "Trying.  .  .".   When  the  connection  becomes
                             ______                established, telnet will say "Open".

     _____     close    Close the  current  network  connection  (if  any).
              ______              Telnet  will  wait  until its internal buffers have
              been emptied before closing the connection.

      ______     (Telnet also implements the "suppress-go-ahead"  option,  by
     accepting it and taking no action.)

     ___ ______     set escape c
                                          _              Set the escape character to c.

     ___ ______ ___     set escape off
              Turn  off  the  escape  character.   This   command

                                             ______              renders it impossible to issue telnet commands.

     Once a connection has  been  opened,  the  messages  "Remote
     echo"  or  "Local echo" may appear.  "Remote echo" indicates
     that typed characters will be echoed  by  the  remote  host,
                                            ______     rather than by the UNIX system running telnet.  "Local echo"
     indicates that typed characters will be echoed by the  local
     host.   When  remote echo is in effect, the normal erase and
     kill line characters will have no effect; instead, they will
     be  transmitted  directly  to  the foreign host.  Similarly,
     INTERRUPT (DEL), QUIT (FS), and EOF (CTRL-D)  will  also  be
     transmitted  to  the  foreign  host.   When local-echo is in
     effect, all these characters will have  their  usual  effect
     except INTERRUPT, which will send a TELNET Interrupt-Process
     command.
