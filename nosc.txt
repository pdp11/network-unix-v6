University of Illinois 'Network Unix'
(from Noel Chiappa)

  The first networked Unix system was one produced at the University of
  Illinois in 1974-75 for use on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>;
  it used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Program">NCP</a> protocol.

  The code is divided into three main groups: code for the kernel (further divided into
  device drivers, and code common to all methods of interfacing to the ARPANET); a daemon
  which ran as a process, which handled a lot of the protocol overhead (e.g. opening and
  closing connections); and programs (also run as processes) to implement applications
  such as FTP and TELNET.

  The code was originally written mostly by Gary R. Grossman and Steve
  F. Holmgren; many others later contributed fixes and improvements. The code
  rapidly spread among computer science centers which were connected to the
  ARPANET; this copy of the code came via NOSC (Naval Ocean Systems Center)
  and SRI.

  Also included are two important major application packages produced
  elsewhere: the MH mail reader, done by Bruce S. Borden at RAND based on
  suggestions by R. Stockton Gaines; and the MMDF mail agent, written by David
  Crocker at the University of Delaware.
