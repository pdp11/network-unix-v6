Hi, John --

Well, after a grim fight, I finally got all the files off your tape.  One
block was unreadable; however after an unbelivable cut-and-paste job on
the file (it was disk1, the copy of the source disk), I got something that
would work.  I had to patch in a block of zeros, but it turned out that the
bad block was in the middle of a recreatable binary, so I'm OK.

To make sure that your tape is OK, I'll read the whole thing back in
before I send it to you.

One curious thing -- I truncated disk1 and disk2 to 4000 blocks, 'cause
that's how big they are (disk3 is 4872, despite what the documentation
says), and wrote it out on one of my tapes using tp.  Now, however, I
can't read it back in!  Any ideas?  There are no tape errors; tp gets a
core dump with a buss error.

I hope you find the problem with your system and get back on soon.
