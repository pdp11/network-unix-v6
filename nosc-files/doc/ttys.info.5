.th TTYS.INFO V 5/10/79
.sh NAME
ttys.info \*- typewriter initialization data
.sh DESCRIPTION
The
.it ttys.info
file is read by the
.it getty
program and specifies
the mode and speeds to try for a typewriter line.
.s3
The file consists of two parts, seperated by a blank line.
The first part consists of the
.it "global messages"
and the second part consists of the
.it "cyclic groups."
.s3
The global messages are common text strings that can be referenced
through a shorthand convention.  One message is present per line.
Leading white space (blanks and tabs) is striped off.
The permitted content of these messages, and the escape conventions
possible, are discussed below.
There are a maximum of nine global messages, one through nine.
The zeroth global message it automaticly defined to be
``\\r\\nLogin: \\7\\7''
-- that is, type the login herald on a line by itself
and followed by two bells.
.s3
In the second part, blank lines, and any line beginning with an
asterick are ignored.  The latter may be used for comments.
It consists of a series of cyclic groups.
The beginning of a cyclic group is identified by a line with a
non-whitespace character in column one.
It continues until the beginning of another cyclic group or to
the end-of-file.
Each cyclic group consists of a set of lines, with each line
containing five fields.
Note that the lines must begin with a whitespace character or they
will be considered the beginning of a cyclic group.
.s3
The five fields are: input speed, output speed, initial flags,
final flags/login option, and message.
The first two fields must be either: (a) a decimal number less than fifty,
or (b) one of the numbers 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800,
2400, 4800, or 9600.  In the latter case, it is converted into the
corresponding speed value.
.s3
The third field and possibly the fourth field consists of a series of
options seperated by a plus (`+') sign.
The options, and their meanings are:
	odd  -- odd parity permitted
	even -- permit even parity
	any  -- permit either parity
	lf   -- treat <cr> and <lf> as identical
	echo -- echo back every character typed
	lc   -- map upper case to lower case
	tab  -- replace tabs by spaces when printing
	hup -- hangup when done
	cr1 cr2 cr3 -- select delay type for carriage return
	nl1 nl2 nl3 -- select delay type for linefeed
	tab1 tab2 tab3 -- select delay type for tab
	ff1  -- select formfeed delay
	bs1  -- select backspace delay

If no option is desired, the special option ``null'' should be used.
.s3
If the fourth field is not a flag value, it must be of the form
``login=name'' and will cause
.it getty
to immediately invoke
.it login
with ``name'' as the value.
.s3
The fifth field is the message to be displayed after the speeds and initial
flags have been set.
It is a C-style string, with the following escapes recoginzed:
	(a) \\r, \\n, \\b, \\\\ are translated into <carriage-return>,
<new-line>, <backspace>, and <backslant>.
	(b) \\<octal-number> is translated into the character corresponding
to <octal-number>
	(c) \\m<digit> causes the <digit>th global message to be expanded.
	(d) \\s<digit> causes the process to sleep for <digit> seconds.
	(e) \\<char> will print <char>.

Any other character is just copied into the output.

The handling of the dial-up line described in
.it getty
