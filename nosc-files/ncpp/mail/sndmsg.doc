SNDMSG(I)                      3/22/76                       SNDMSG(I)




NAME
          sndmsg - send a message

SYNOPSIS
          sndmsg

DESCRIPTION
             SNDMSG is a message sending  program  modeled  after  the
     Tenex  program  sndmsg.   When  invoked,  sndmsg will ask for two
     lists of recipients, a primary list and a  secondary  list.   Any
     person  whose  name appears on either list will receive the note,
     and the only difference between the  two  lists  is  whether  the
     person's  name  comes under the heading 'To' or 'cc'.  The format
     is the same for both lists - a series of names separated by  com-
     mas.  Each name on the list must be one of the following:

        a name listed in the alias file (see below)
        the login-name of a unix user
        a file name immediately followed by a colon
        a network address of the form <name>@<site>
          (the @ character is disabled as a line-delete while
          the 'To' and 'cc' lists are being typed

             The alias file contains entries indicating  that  a  name
     used  in  sndmsg  is to be replaced by other names.  For example,
     the following entry -

        skiers:jal,wahrman@RCC,/etc/skilist:

     would indicate that any messages which included 'skiers'  in  the
     distribution  list  would  go  to  jal, wahrman@RCC, and everyone
     listed in the file /etc/skilist.  Each entry in  the  alias  file
     must  fit  in  a  single line.  This limitation does not hold for
     files, however, so an alias entry can point to a file (as in this
     example) in order to increase the number of people in refers to.

             A file can be specified in the  distribution  list;  this
     file  should  contain  names  of  people  to receive the message.
     Searching through files and through the alias file is not  recur-
     sive, so an entry for an alias name may not include another alias
     name (or a file which contains alias names), and a file  may  not
     include  a  file  name  (or  an  alias name which contains a file
     name).  This has some advantages: for example, the following  en-
     try -

        bobg:bobg,Greenberg@BBN

     would indicate that any messages sent to the  name  'bobg'  would
     show  up  in  the  local mailbox for bobg and also be sent to the
     network address shown.

             If sndmsg is called by the server FTP, the alias facility
     also becomes available for incoming network mail.

             At this time, messages which include any network users on

     the distribution list who are a  sites  other  than  Rand-RCC  or
     Rand-ISD will be monitored by the correspondence office.

             After the 'To' and 'cc' lists have been  entered,  sndmsg
     will ask for a subject.  If it is necessary to type more than one
     line of text for the subject or either of the recipient lists,  a
     newline  character preceded  by a backslash (the unix literal es-
     cape) can be used anywhere in the text.   There  is,  however,  a
     maximum of 256 characters allowed for each of the above inputs.

          After  you have entered the subject and recipient lists, you
     will  be  prompted for the text of your message.   While entering
     your message, you can use a hybrid of the unix and sndmsg editing
     characters.

          ^a       teletype-oriented character delete
          ^b       include the contents of some file into the text
          ^d       end of message
          ^f       equivalent to ^b
          ^h       scope oriented character delete
          ^r       retype the current line
          ^s       retype the entire message
	  ^w       delete the preceding word
          ^x       line delete
          ^z       equivalent to ^d
          @        line delete  (standard unix character)
          #        character delete  (standard unix character)
          bs       character delete
          del      interrupt  (standard unix character)
          \        can be used in the standard Unix way as a literal
                     escape and to enter full ASCII on a half-ASCII
                     terminal

          After you have finished entering and editing  your  message,
     type a ^d or a ^z to tell sndmsg that you are done.  It will then
     try to mail the message to all of the recipients.   The  name  of
     each  recipient  will  be printed out with the results of the at-
     tempt to send the message  to that  person.    Mail  for  network
     users will be queued for later handling by a mailer daemon.

DIAGNOSTICS
          All diagnostic messages are intended to be self explanatory.

BUGS
          The control-w handling is quite sloppy.
